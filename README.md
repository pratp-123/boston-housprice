## libraries and tools

## spread and skewness of each numerical feature
Several predictors require scaling or transformation due to skewness.

The normal distribution of RM and the negative correlation of LSTAT and CRIM with price confirm the linear and socioeconomic relationships in the dataset.

Understanding these patterns guided effective feature engineering and model tuning in this project.

You’ll see whether features like RM (rooms per dwelling) or LSTAT (lower status population %) are normally distributed or skewed.


## Relationship Between Key Features and Target
✅ Insight:
🔹 2️⃣ Feature vs Price Relationships (Multi-Plot Visualization)
🏠 (a) RM vs Price (Average Number of Rooms)

A clear positive correlation — as the number of rooms (RM) increases, the house price also increases.

Indicates that larger homes tend to have higher market values.

💰 (b) LSTAT vs Price (Lower-Status Population Percentage)
Shows a strong negative correlation — as LSTAT increases, house price decreases.
Suggests that wealthier neighborhoods (low LSTAT) have higher-priced homes.

📏 (c) PTRATIO vs Price (Pupil-Teacher Ratio)
Weak to moderate negative relationship — higher student-to-teacher ratios slightly lower home prices.
Implies that better educational quality (lower PTRATIO) can positively impact property value.

🚗 (d) DIS vs Price (Distance to Employment Centers)
Weak correlation — houses closer to employment centers (lower DIS) often have slightly higher prices, but effect varies.
Suggests other features may dominate price determination.

🚨 (e) CRIM vs Price (Per Capita Crime Rate)
Strong negative correlation — areas with higher crime rates (CRIM) tend to have lower home prices.
Confirms that safety is a key determinant of housing value.

### scatter of predicted and actual data points
📊 Insights from Visualizations
🔹 1️⃣ Actual vs Predicted Prices (Scatter Plot)

- The scatter plot shows Actual (x-axis) vs Predicted (y-axis) house prices.

- Most points lie close to the diagonal line, indicating that predictions are generally accurate.

 A few deviations suggest minor underfitting/overfitting, but overall, the model captures the relationship well.

- This confirms the model’s strong predictive performance, likely reflected in a high R² score.

- The consistent trend along the diagonal shows that the Random Forest Regressor effectively learned the mapping between features and price.

### 🎓 Key Learnings

Gained hands-on experience with the end-to-end Machine Learning workflow — starting from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to understand dataset patterns, and analyze feature correlations.

Learned effective data preprocessing techniques including handling missing values, outlier treatment, and feature scaling using StandardScaler to prepare clean, normalized data for modeling.

Applied feature engineering by selecting important variables through correlation and feature importance analysis, and creating derived or polynomial features to capture complex relationships.

Implemented multiple regression algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting using scikit-learn, and improved their performance with k-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalization.

Performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV to optimize model parameters and select the best-performing regressor.

Evaluated models using key metrics like R² Score, MAE, MSE, and RMSE, and visualized results through residual plots, predicted vs actual graphs, and feature importance charts for deeper interpretation.

Automated the entire process using GitHub Actions (CI/CD), enabling automatic testing, building, and deployment of the model through Dockerized pipelines.

Successfully deployed the Flask-based application on Render.com, integrating the Render API and Service ID for seamless continuous deployment.

Strengthened understanding of model lifecycle management, version control using Git & GitHub, and real-world deployment of ML models for production use.
